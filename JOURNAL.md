## 10/4/2025 - deciding stuff  

so, i have decided that i will be making an FPGA dev board in a raspi pico form factor, which will have the ice40up5k FPGA with 5280 LUTs. Here are some other things that i will need:

- A programming interface
- a flash storage
- cramming everything in rpi pico form factor
- USB-C
- required voltage regulators(3.3v and 1.2v prolly)
- too many LEDs(with suitable resistors)
Yeah that's all ig
and yes no castellations because they are expensive, and i'll solder the board myself at home yay

## 10/6/2025 - Idea Changed  

There are some things i want to change, first of all, i cannot figure out how to program the FPGA, as there are two ways, first you use a flash configured where the FPGA is the SPI master and the second is programming from an external MCU, where the FPGA acts as a slave. So i have an idea, I WILL USE THE RP2350 along with the FPGA. So yes, the board cost will be upped a little bit ig. i will still try to maintain the rpi pico form factor and use all the GPIOs, but if it is not possible then also it is fine as i will have many many GPIOs.

here are other things that i have decided to put:
1x RGB LED.
4x normal LEDs
2x power LEDs(3.3v and 1.2v both)
a buck convertor with 2 channels (most probably [RT8075ZQW](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C250416.html))

it would look something like this:

## 10/13/2025 - Started with the schematic + minor placement  

umm yeah, i started with the schematic for the devboard, it went well.  

first i couldn't figure out some things like different voltages and i was concerced if i would need 2.5 volts too. but some wise people on the internet told that i can tie the VPP_2V5 pin to 3.3v directly. so yeah here it is.

and i think i will have to share a lot of GPIO to output to the headers. the space is very very small.  

here's how the power part(dual buck converter) looks like:

I basically wired the basics of FPGA and the rp2350a. now in the next sesh i will connect both the chips and add headers and hopefully i will be done with the schematic.
