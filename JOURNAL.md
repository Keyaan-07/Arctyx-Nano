## 10/4/2025 - deciding stuff  

so, i have decided that i will be making an FPGA dev board in a raspi pico form factor, which will have the ice40up5k FPGA with 5280 LUTs. Here are some other things that i will need:

- A programming interface
- a flash storage
- cramming everything in rpi pico form factor
- USB-C
- required voltage regulators(3.3v and 1.2v prolly)
- too many LEDs(with suitable resistors)
Yeah that's all ig
and yes no castellations because they are expensive, and i'll solder the board myself at home yay

## 10/6/2025 - Idea Changed  

There are some things i want to change, first of all, i cannot figure out how to program the FPGA, as there are two ways, first you use a flash configured where the FPGA is the SPI master and the second is programming from an external MCU, where the FPGA acts as a slave. So i have an idea, I WILL USE THE RP2350 along with the FPGA. So yes, the board cost will be upped a little bit ig. i will still try to maintain the rpi pico form factor and use all the GPIOs, but if it is not possible then also it is fine as i will have many many GPIOs.

here are other things that i have decided to put:
1x RGB LED.
4x normal LEDs
2x power LEDs(3.3v and 1.2v both)
a buck convertor with 2 channels (most probably [RT8075ZQW](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C250416.html))

it would look something like this:
